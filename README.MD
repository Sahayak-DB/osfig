# Open Source Forensic Integrity Guard

The OSFIG system is designed to provide a measurable level of commercial and enterprise type capabilities to the open source community.
Key capabilities:

* Serverless model
* File Integrity Monitoring
* Centralized server to aggregate results for easy reporting (optional and planned for later)

**Status:**

While this project has ambitious goals for future capabilities, it is clearly in an early state. No contributions expected, though always willing to accept any constructive feedback or ideas about future direction.

While it remains in version < 1.0 it is to be expected that any updated release will break the formatting of configuration files, results files, and certainly doesn't include a proper multi-platform testing and vetting process. You are welcome to use and provide feedback, however it is not considered release and production stable until the 1.0 release.

That said, development is progressing nicely. I expect only a couple more alpha and beta version before a bump to 1.0.
